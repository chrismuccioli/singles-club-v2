            <h3 class="py2"> In advance of his 2012 release, <i>Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads</i>, Dustin Wong launched a project asking fans to submit their own dreams for him to sonically reinterpret. By then, Dustin had developed a reputation for his intricate guitar work—first with the beloved Baltimore bands Ponytail and Ecstatic Sunshine, and later on his psychedelic solo debut, <i>Infinite Love</i>, where effects pedals were deployed like paint brushes. His virtuosity had established a direct line to my subconscious, and now here was a chance to invert that dynamic, to transmit a signal back, to engage with a musical hero on a highly rare and personal level. It happens that I experience a reoccurring dream, one I’ve come to know well enough to retell into my laptop. I sent the voice recording to Dustin, and weeks later, he aired the first piece: “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/dustin-wong/daves-dream" target="_blank">Dave’s Dream: Gold Dust and Skateboarding.</a>” I was floored: Dustin had taken these nonsensical constructs and spun them into a narrative cocoon, giving an inadvertently imagined scene its soundtrack.  </h3>

            <p class="py2">This concept would inspire a reinvention for <a href="http://stadiumsandshrines.com/" target="_blank">Stadiums & Shrines</a>, the music website I run with visual artist Nathaniel Whitcomb and photographer Victoria Masters. Just months after I’d taken part in Dustin’s dream series, S&S introduced its new core initiative, “Dreams,” inviting artists to compose original scores for Nathaniel’s handmade collages, composites of vintage tourism photography depicting locales from a bygone era. As its first recruit, Dustin finished his "Dream of Japan" just after Thrill Jockey Records released <i>Dreams Say, View, Create, Shadow Leads</i> (which would top S&S’ favorite albums of 2012 and remains forever in its DNA). Subsequently, he’d ask us if it was "cool" to include "Japan" on 2013 LP <i>Mediation of Ecstatic Energy</i>: the answer was yes, very cool. </p>

            <p class="py2">Meanwhile, a new creative partner had entered Dustin’s universe. In the summer of 2011, he’d met experimental artist and former Shibuya-kei singer Takako Minekawa. Mutual fans—Takako owned <i>Infinite Love</i>, Dustin had been listening to her work since the late 90s—they exchanged emails after one of his Tokyo shows. Dustin returned in the winter of 2012 and the pen pals started jamming. It was a revelation for both, given his hesitance to record with others again, and her decade-long hiatus from music entirely. </p>

            <p class="py2">Dustin and Takako’s story is told here, with excerpts from a recollection between the two, transcribed from Japanese. The interview can be heard in full on Side B of SC008. Side A features “Payapaya”, a song written for this very project, paired with a collage Nathaniel made while listening to it. We’ve come full circle now, or perhaps, are now dreaming in reverse.</p>

            <h5> It took me a little while for me to open myself up for collaboration after Ponytail broke up. But when it came to making music with Takako, the process was never uncomfortable, the music making always felt like conversations to me. Creativity through intuition is something that I really love, so I think when it comes to collaboration, if the means are through intuition, I can open my heart. </h5>

            <h5>I have a son, and when he was a baby, I stopped listening to music altogether for a few years. I'm not quite sure what happened. It was as if a laptop computer crashed and its memory got erased (laughs). From that point, I listened to music in increments. That process was pretty interesting; I started to reconnect with sounds that I felt an affinity with. Then I listened to music with structure, and a little bit of experimental stuff. And when listening, I would look out the window and see green plants and trees swaying in the wind; it was as if their leaves were making the sounds. That’s where I began to rediscover the joys of music. It was really refreshing for me, and in that process I ran into Dustin’s music. </h5>

There was a gap after that, I think we reconnected in the summer of 2012 and re-conceptualized how we can make this project work. Dustin suggested that we should try having the vocal and guitar looped on one single pedal. It felt like an invention almost. This is kind of where things started to expand in our hardware interface. </h5>

                <p>The duo released <i>Toropical Circle</i> in 2013. The title and self-directed, pastel-flickering video for “Party on a Floating Cake” sums up the record’s vibe: playful, primal, cozy, cosmic. It’s perhaps lighter and less restrained than anything the two had made individually to date. And 2014’s Savage Imagination would explore this lightness even further. </p>

Coming from such diverse musical backgrounds, the development of their own interface would be key to pushing the limits of their collaboration. Allowing them to shift calmly between guitar, keyboards, sampler, and vocoder, they’ve since continued to tap into the endless possibilities some of their gear has afforded them. Their ability to use but not depend on pedals and knobs makes them one of the most cathartic live acts. Above, we’ve attempted to give a snapshot of their live and recording set up to provide an insiders view of how it all comes together. </h3>
