          <h3 class="py2">On June 18th, 2010 Woodsman would play their first show in Brooklyn. The Denver-based band, at the time a quartet, had seen the first half of a monthlong US tour spanning most of the country before heading back to Colorado. It was a crowded summer night in Williamsburg. The air was sticky, anxiously purring, the sun streaked down into a purple-hued gloaming over the East River. They were slated to perform at the Monster Island Basement. </h3>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col col-8 col-offset-2">
          <p class="py2">Gone without a trace, the Monster Island Basement was once half a square-block on River Street by the Williamsburg waterfront that held an art gallery, a hall of practice spaces, a single residence, and an intimate venue primarily for emerging local and national artists. Many of the acts that played the basement would “not be playing this kind of venue for much longer,” the media would perpetuate, but these sorts of rooms had long been a staple of the New York City art-party scene. This ethos was at fever pitch in 2010.</p>

          <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/300/300" class="right image-right-p3 float-image oh">

          <p class="py2">The authenticity of a tiny venue with hoards of musicians, artists, and chic photographers had even enticed hip-hop mogul Damon Dash to go DIY, throwing shows in his studio basement in Manhattan with the help of a few young, enterprising New Yorkers. They deemed it Under 100, pairing locals with widely known acts like Erykah Badu and Mos Def. It was the height of blog-rock. Bands like the <a href="#">Vivian Girls</a> and WAVVES went from forming in ash-covered practice spaces to selling out venues seemingly overnight, Athens’ Black Kids were signed to Columbia Records after posting one track to MySpace, and mischievous sites like Pitchfork, Chocolate Bobka, and Get Off The Coast were informing the record industry more than Rolling Stone and SPIN. It was an exciting time to be in a band, it seemed like anyone could make it, and fast with a pinch of luck.</p>

          <p class="py2">  After months of demoing in Denver, Woodsman had seen some of this luck. With several tracks leaked across the blogosphere, Woodsman’s moss covered kraut-rock had garnered the attention of young upstart label Mexican Summer, leading to the release of Collages, one of their earliest full-fledged albums in December of 2009. “Any attention was a shock to us in the first place,” drummer Dylan Shumaker recounts. </p>
